One-shot video objects tracking and segmentation: tracking via object parts and segmentation via mask propagation on parts. Combining the ideas from
FAVOS \[[1](https://github.com/JingchunCheng/FAVOS)\] and RGMP \[[2](https://github.com/seoungwugoh/RGMP)\], we propose to use
FPN \[[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03144)\] as backbone to track object parts and propagate their masks in a unified network similar to Mask R-CNN \[[3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870)\].
The proposed model does not need fine-tuning on the 0th frame where the ground truth segmentation mask is provided. Instead, our model learns a similarity representation via
cross-correlation between templar feature patch and search sub-window. Inspired by Fully-Convolutional Siamese Network for Object Tracking \[[4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09549)\], our model also tracks object pixels
 via mask propagation. We believe that tracking object pixels is feasible even if the object motion is non-rigid as long as the model is trained using a large
 amount of data. Flownet \[[5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06852)\] is a good example of tracking scene pixels from one frame to another regardless of object categories.
